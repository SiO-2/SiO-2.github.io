        - title: Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference in Untrusted Clouds
        - Identified critical privacy leaks in cloud inference due to vulnerable externalized KV-caches.
        - Analyzed reconstruction risks, providing the first empirical evidence of prompt leakage in Llama/Qwen architectures without raw input access.
        - Architected a lightweight obfuscation defense natively integrated with PagedAttention, mitigating privacy risks while ensuring lossless accuracy with < 1% latency overhead.
        - Core algorithms were integrated into large-scale production inference frameworks; yielded 1 top-tier paper and 1 patent.
