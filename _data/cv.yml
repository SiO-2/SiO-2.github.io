      description:
        - Topic: Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference in Untrusted Clouds
        - Gap Analysis: Identified critical privacy leaks in cloud inference due to vulnerable externalized KV-caches.
        - Vulnerability Analysis: Analyzed reconstruction risks, providing the \textbf{first empirical evidence} of prompt leakage in Llama/Qwen architectures without raw input access.
        - System Design (KV-Cloak): Architected a lightweight obfuscation defense natively integrated with \textbf{PagedAttention}, mitigating privacy risks while ensuring lossless accuracy with \textbf{$<$1\% latency overhead}.
        - Impact: Core algorithms were integrated into \textbf{large-scale production inference frameworks}; yielded 1 top-tier paper and 1 patent.
