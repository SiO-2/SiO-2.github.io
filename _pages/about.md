I am currently a final-year Master's student in [Cyberspace Security](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn/icsren/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhanqin). I am also a member of the [State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security](https://bcds.zju.edu.cn/). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University in 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Machine Learning Systems (MLsys). I am particularly interested in identifying and mitigating privacy risks in modern inference systems, with a specific focus on KV-Cache privacy, side-channel analysis, and endogenous security mechanisms.
