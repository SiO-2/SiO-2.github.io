I am currently a final-year Master's student in [Cyberspace Security](https://icsr.zju.edu.cn/icsren/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Prof. [Zhan Qin](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhanqin). I am also a member of the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security. Previously, I received my B.S. degree in [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University in 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Machine Learning Systems (MLsys). I am particularly interested in identifying and mitigating privacy risks in modern inference systems, with a specific focus on KV-Cache privacy, side-channel analysis, and endogenous security mechanisms.

Recently, I have been working on securing LLM inference in untrusted clouds. My work, "Shadow in the Cache," which uncovers novel privacy risks in KV-cache and proposes efficient mitigation strategies, has been accepted (with minor revision) to NDSS 2026.
